## \_vbXML 0\.02\_


</div>

### Description

The second release of vbXML, version 0.02. Included is a more advenced (and better looking) example showing the usage of the three new functions. I also took the time to write up a quick readme file (included in the zip). For those of you that dont know what vbXML is:

It is a class wrapper for the MSXML Library. Currently supported is the 2.0 version (because I cant upgrade to 4.0 on Win98)
